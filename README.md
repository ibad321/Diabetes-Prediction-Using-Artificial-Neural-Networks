# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict diabetes in patients. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various medical features such as glucose levels and blood pressure. The ANN model is trained and evaluated to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on these features.
